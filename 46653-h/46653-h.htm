<p class="center">THE GAMBLING-HOUSE.</p>


<p>"I rather like this game!"</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile if you didn't. Luck's
dead sot in for you now, you can bet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the
first speaker; "but I
don't propose to follow
it up."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The second speaker
sprang from his chair in
amazement.</p>

<p>"No. I flatter myself
I know when to stop. I
have played at Baden
and Monaco, in the clubs
of London and the hells
of Paris, as well as the
gambling saloons of the
West, and I'm not to be
picked up for a flat."</p>

<p>"That's sure; but look
at here; as sure as my
name is Dan Markham,
and I'm known as a profesh
at gambling from
here to Cheyenne and
Virginia City, and lettin'
alone Omaha, you're
wrong."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"When you've got a
run of luck, play it for all
it is worth."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"My friend, fortune is
within your grasp. Play
on the ace and copper
the jack, I tell you," replied
Dan Markham.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I don't
want any one to dictate
to me."</p>

<p>With this quiet answer
the first speaker piled
up his checks and received
an equally large
pile of gold twenty-dollar
pieces, which he placed
in an inside pocket of his
coat. Then he laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I
do this sort of thing," he
remarked. "It isn't because
I want the money."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," replied
the gambler.</p>

<p>The lucky player rose
from his seat and the
game went on, there
being a dozen or more
men present who were
intent upon it.</p>

<p>The game was faro.</p>

<p>Slowly and solemnly
the dealer took the cards
out of the box, and with
equal solemnity the players
moved their checks
as their fancy dictated.</p>

<p>The first speaker was
a man of a decided English
cast of countenance,
and the profusion of side
whiskers which he wore
strengthened his Britannic
look.</p>

<p>He was well dressed,
handsome, though somewhat
haggard, as if he
suffered from want of
sleep, or had some cankering
care gnawing at
his heart.</p>

<p>A gold ring, set with
turquoise and diamonds,
sparkled on his finger,
and his watch chain was
heavy and massive. The gambler was probably
forty years of age, which was ten or twelve more
than his companion, and his face bore traces of drink
and dissipation; but there was a shrewd, good-natured
twinkle in his eye which showed that he
was not a bad-natured man in the main. In reality,
Dan Markham was known all over the Pacific Slope
as a good fellow.</p>

<p>Retiring to the lower end of the room, the first
speaker accepted a glass of wine which was handed
him by a negro waiter who attended on the supper-table.</p>

<p>"You were saying, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Markham," replied that individual.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! Thank you! Well, you were observing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just this: I know
why a man plays, even
though he's well fixed
and has got heaps of
shug."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr."
continued Markham, imitating
his companion's
tone in rather a mocking
manner.</p>

<p>"Smith. Call me
Smith."</p>

<p>"All right, Smith; you
play because you want
the excitement. That's
the secret of it. You've
got no home."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"No wife?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Exactly. If a man's
got a home, and the
comforts, and the young
ones, and in fact all that
the word implies, he
don't want to go to a
gambling-saloon. No,
sir. It's fellows like you
and me that buck the
tiger."</p>

<p>The person who had
designated himself as
Mr. Smith smiled.</p>

<p>"You are an observer
of human nature?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess so.
Pete!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah!" replied
the negro.</p>

<p>"Give me some of that
wine. Darn your black
skin, what do I keep you
for?"</p>

<p>"You don't keep me,
sah!" replied the negro.</p>

<p>"Don't I, by gosh?
It's me, and fellows like
me, that keep this saloon
a-going, and that keeps
you."</p>

<p>Pete made no reply,
but opened a new bottle
and handed the gambler
a glass of the sparkling
wine.</p>

<p>"Going to play some
more, stranger?" asked
Dan.</p>

<p>"I may and I may
not. As I feel at present
I shall look on," replied
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"How long have you
been in this country?"
continued Dan.</p>

<p>"All my life."</p>

<p>"Hy?"</p>

<p>"I was born here."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"In Maine."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now; you
can't play that on me.
You're a Britisher."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith colored a
little and looked rather
vexed.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it strike you,
my friend," he said,
"that you are a trifle
inquisitive?"</p>

<p>"It's my way."</p>

<p>"Then all I have to
say is that it is a mighty unpleasant way, and I don't
like it for a cent."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you can lump it," replied Dan Markham,
lighting a cigar and staring him in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith evidently did not want to have a quarrel,
for he walked away and strolled through the
rooms, of which there were four.</p>

<p>These rooms were elegantly furnished, provided
with sofas and easy-chairs. On the tables were all
the best periodicals and magazines, so that frequenters
of the gambling-house could while away their
time without actually playing.</p>

<p>But the tables possessed a fascination which
Smith, as he called himself, could not resist.</p>

<p>He strolled back to the faro game and watched
the play, which kept on incessantly.</p>

<p>When one player fell out, another took his place,
and so it went on, all night long, till the garish
streaks of the gray dawn stole in through the shades
of the windows, and the men who turned night into
day thought it prudent to go home.</p>

<p>A young and handsome man attracted Mr. Smith's
attention. He was well dressed, and had an air of
refinement about him. His eyes were bloodshot
and his face haggard. His hands clutched the
chips nervously, and he was restless, feverish and
excited.</p>

<p>He pushed the clustering chestnut locks from his
fair brow, and watched the cards as they came out
with an eagerness that showed he took more than
an ordinary interest in the game.</p>

<p>His luck was villainous.</p>

<p>He lost almost every time, and when he tried to
make a "pot" to recoup himself, it was all the
same&mdash;the wrong card came out.</p>

<p>At length he put his hand in his pocket and found
no more money there.</p>

<p>With a sigh he rose from the table, and with
bowed head and bent back, his eyes lowered and
his face wearing an expression which was the embodiment
of despair, he walked away.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith followed him.</p>

<p>This was a type of character and a situation he
evidently liked to study.</p>

<p>"Ruined! Ruined!" he muttered.</p>

<p>At this juncture he encountered Dan Markham,
who had been paying his respects to some boned
turkey, and making a very respectable supper.</p>

<p>The professional gambler can always eat and
drink, the fluctuations of the game having very
little effect on his appetite.</p>

<p>"Hello! Baby," he exclaimed; "you here again
to-night?"</p>

<p>"As you see," replied the young man, whose
feminine cast of countenance justified the epithet
of "Baby" which the gambler had bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p>"I thought I told you to keep out of here."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you follow my orders?"</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't. It was here that I took
the first downward step, and to-night I have taken
the last."</p>

<p>The gambler regarded him curiously.</p>

<p>"Clarence Holt," he said, "have you been
drinking?"</p>

<p>"Not a drop; but it is time I did. My lips are
parched and dry. I am on fire, brain and body.
Is this a foretaste of the hereafter in store for me?"</p>

<p>"Weak-minded fool!" cried Dan.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was weak-minded to trust you. I was a
fool to listen to your rose-colored stories about fortunes
made at a faro-bank."</p>

<p>"Come, come! no kicking."</p>

<p>During this conversation Mr. Smith was leaning
against the wall, half concealed in the shadow,
and smoking a cigar, while he was ostensibly engaged
in jotting down some memoranda with a
pencil on a scrap of paper, yet not a word was
lost upon him.</p>

<p>"You can bully me as much as you please, Dan
Markham!" exclaimed Clarence Holt. "But I
warn you that I am getting tired of it."</p>

<p>"Tired, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there is a limit to human endurance."</p>

<p>"Is there? Since when did you find that out?"
sneered Dan.</p>

<p>"To-night. I have lost a whole month's salary."</p>

<p>"What of that? I'll lend you money."</p>

<p>"Yes, on the terms you did before," replied
Clarence Holt, bitterly. "You have made me forge
the name of the manager of the bank in which I am
employed to the extent of three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"That isn't much."</p>

<p>"I can never pay it."</p>

<p>Dan Markham lowered his voice almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," he said.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Steal it. You have every opportunity."</p>

<p>"And become a thief?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Why not? Are you not already a forger? I
hold three notes of Mr. Simpson, the manager of
the Bank of California, which he never signed,
though you did it for him; and if those notes are presented
for payment you will go right up to the
State Prison at Stockton quicker than railroading."</p>

<p>Clarence Holt groaned deeply.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, in the power of this man, and,
struggle as he could, he was unable to extricate
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith gathered from this conversation that
Dan Markham had got the young man in his power
with some object in view.</p>

<p>Clarence Holt was a clerk in the Bank of California,
and had forged the name of Mr. Simpson, the
manager, to the extent of three thousand dollars,
Markham holding the forged notes.</p>

<p>That evening Clarence had risked his whole
mouth's salary at faro, and lost.</p>

<p>Hence his despair and agitation were fully accounted
for.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" asked Clarence.</p>

<p>"My money."</p>

<p>"What will you take for the notes?"</p>

<p>"Double their face-value, and then I'll hand them
over to anybody."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith stepped forward and bowed politely.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said he. "Did I understand you
to say that you are anxious to sell some notes?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, Mr. Smith," replied Markham. "If
you've got six thousand dollars to throw away on
security which is only worth three, we can deal. I
want to go to Sacramento to-morrow, and I'll sell
out."</p>

<p>"I have overheard the entire conversation," said
Mr. Smith, "and I sincerely commiserate this
young man, who has fallen into the hands of a
sharper!"</p>

<p>"Throwing bricks, eh?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, my friend. Hand over the
notes and I will give you the money."</p>

<p>Markham produced a wallet which was filled with
papers and bills, among which he searched until he
found the documents of which he was in want.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he exclaimed. "I'd like to find
a fool like you every day in the week."</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"If I did, I'd die rich."</p>

<p>Laughing heartily at his own joke, Markham
handed over the notes and received the six thousand
dollars in exchange.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he added, and extending his hand
to Clarence Holt, he said: "Good-by. Take my
advice. It's straight. Never bet on a card again."</p>

<p>Nodding carelessly to Mr. Smith, he knocked the
ash off his cigar and left the room.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Clarence Holt grasped Mr.
Smith's hand.</p>

<p>"How can I thank you?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," replied Mr. Smith, "you have
nothing to thank me for."</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"But you have saved me," said Clarence. "You
are a whole-souled, generous-hearted man. Give
me the forged notes, that I may tear them up, begin
again, and, leading a new life, bless you for ever."</p>

<p>A cynical smile curled the lip of Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my young friend," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Simply that I am not your friend, and that I
have not done anything of a particularly generous
nature."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Clarence Holt's countenance fell again as he ejaculated
this monosyllable.</p>

<p>"You have only exchanged one master for another,"
replied Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said Clarence, "I am at a loss to
understand you. I took you for a gentleman who,
having by accident overheard a conversation which
was not intended for his ears, endeavored to atone
for his conduct by doing what lay in his power to
help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't catechise me, if you please," interrupted
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to be offensive."</p>

<p>"If you had I would not allow you to gratify your
inclination. Mr. Markham has handed you over to
me, and I have bought you."</p>

<p>"Bought me?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly."</p>

<p>"May I ask your reason for acting in such an
eccentric manner?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I like to buy men. It is a fancy of mine.
I find them useful occasionally."</p>

<p>Clarence Holt bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>A card containing an address in Mission Street
was handed to him, and, glancing carelessly at it, he
put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"When I want you," he said, "I shall know
where to find you."</p>

<p>A rebellious fire burnt in Clarence's eye.</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse to do your bidding?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, in that case I should go to the bank
and show the authorities the notes I have bought.
I presume they would see that you were punished,
and taken care of for a year or two."</p>

<p>Clarence pressed his hands together violently.</p>

<p>"Oh! have I come to this?" he cried. "Would
to God I had taken my dear wife's advice and never
gambled!"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked at him.</p>

<p>"Married, eh?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Pretty wife?"</p>

<p>"The most divine creature you ever saw. I suppose
I am a partial judge, and that my opinion is
not to be relied on; but I assure you, sir, that no
artist or poet ever conceived so lovely a specimen
of womanhood as my darling Elise."</p>

<p>"Humph! How long have you been married?"</p>

<p>"Three years."</p>

<p>"And in love still?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; more than ever."</p>

<p>"Odd way of showing your love, coming to a
gambling-house. Any children?"</p>

<p>"One little girl. But allow me to explain. I
came here with my month's salary to try and make
money enough to pay off Markham, who has been
my ruin. Now I have not a dollar to go home with,
and how we are to live I do not know."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith took a dozen twenty-dollar gold pieces
out of his purse.</p>

<p>"Take these," he said.</p>

<p>"You will lend them to me?" cried Clarence, delightedly.</p>

<p>"I give them to you. What is the use of lending
money to a pauper? I give this to you just as I
would give an alms to a beggar."</p>

<p>"Your words are very bitter," said the young
man, as he shivered visibly.</p>

<p>"There is no necessity for me to be silver-tongued
with you," was the reply. "Go home to your
wife. I will call and see you soon."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith threw himself into a chair, and appeared
to take no further notice of Clarence, but he
was seated in a manner which permitted him to
have a good view of the gambling-table.</p>

<p>At first Clarence Holt hurried toward the door,
as if full of virtuous resolution to return home.</p>

<p>Then he paused, and turned off toward the lunch
table, where he ate a little salad and drank some
wine.</p>

<p>The gold pieces were burning a hole in his pocket.</p>

<p>They were amply sufficient to live upon for a
month; but if he could only double them!</p>

<p>Surely his bad luck could not stick to him all the
evening.</p>

<p>He would try again.</p>

<p>"What time is it?"&mdash;he looked up at the clock&mdash;"only
eleven!" Elise, his little wife, has got the
baby to sleep by this time and is probably reading,
while eagerly expecting his return home. Another
hour will make no great difference.</p>

<p>He goes to the table and buys some checks, with
which he begins to speculate.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith laughs with the air of Mephisto, and
says to himself:</p>

<p>"I knew it. Score one to me again for having
some knowledge of character. He is a weak man
and easily led. So much the better for me."</p>

<p>Presently a lady, thickly vailed, entered the saloon
and looked timidly around her.</p>

<p>Evidently she was searching for some one.</p>

<p>Seldom, indeed, was a lady seen in the saloon,
for it is not the custom for the fair sex to gamble in
America, whatever they may do in Europe.</p>

<p>The negro in charge of the lunch-table advanced
toward her.</p>

<p>"What you want heah, ma'am?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am looking for a gentleman," she replied, in a
nervous tone.</p>

<p>"Plenty ob gen'elmen come and go all night.
It's as hard as de debble to find any one in dese ar
rooms."</p>

<p>"He is my husband. Perhaps you know him.
His name is Clarence Holt," continued the lady.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, for suah. I know him."</p>

<p>"Then I implore you to tell me if he is here.
Where is the room in which they play?"</p>

<p>"No place for ladies, dat; besides, Marse Holt
him been gone an hour or more with Marse Markham."</p>

<p>"Is he with that bad man? Ah, me! what
future have I and my child now?"</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her face and sobbed,
while the negro held the door open.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud cry from the inner
room, in which the game was progressing.</p>

<p>"By heaven. I win! Give it me. It is all mine.
All&mdash;all," shouted a man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt uttered a scream.</p>

<p>"'Tis he!" she cried. "Wretch, you have deceived
me. Stand on one side. I heard my husband's
voice, and I will see him."</p>

<p>She pushed past the negro, who would fain have
stopped her had he been able to do so, but her
movements were too quick for him to intercept her.</p>

<p>"This is becoming decidedly interesting," observed
Mr. Smith; "Elise has come after Clarence.
By Jove!" he added, as she raised her vail, "she
justifies his description of her. A prettier creature
I never saw!"</p>

<p>The luck had changed, and Clarence had been
fortunate enough to win largely, as a pile of gold
by his side fully testified.</p>

<p>The young wife tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Clarence," she whispered.</p>

<p>"You here?" he cried, while a flush of annoyance
crossed his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; forgive me. Come home, will you
not?"</p>

<p>"How dare you follow me here?"</p>

<p>"I was so lonely. I found a note from Markham
appointing a meeting here, and I knew you had
your salary with you. We have no food in the
house, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he interrupted, almost fiercely.
"Do you want every man here to know our private
affairs?"</p>

<p>"What are these men to you, Clarence?"</p>

<p>"Go home. I will come when I am ready. You
distract me. Go!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sadly she turned away. Her tears flowed fast, and
so broken-hearted was she that she did not bestow
one glance at the feverish and excited face of her
erring and misguided husband.</p>

<p>At the door she was confronted by Mr. Smith,
who bowed politely.</p>

<p>"Madame," he exclaimed, "permit me to have
the honor of escorting you to your carriage."</p>

<p>Elise Holt looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"I have no carriage, sir," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then I will get you one."</p>

<p>"But I have no money to pay for one."</p>

<p>"My purse is at your service."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she exclaimed, blushing, "it would
not be right for me to accept a favor from a perfect
stranger."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I am a friend of your husband."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, if you know Clarence, will
you not persuade him to come home?"</p>

<p>She looked pleadingly at Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>"I will do more than that," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I will see to it that he does come to you in half
an hour. Come, take my arm."</p>

<p>Elise did not hesitate any longer, but timidly
placed her little delicately-gloved hand on the arm
of the handsome stranger, who was so kind and
generous.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she thought, "if I had married him instead
of Clarence!"</p>

<p>They descended the stairs together, and her tears
ceased to flow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A SURPRISE.</p>


<p>In the street they saw a carriage, which Mr.
Smith hailed, and when it drove up he placed
Mrs. Holt inside.</p>

<p>"Drive this lady to No. 113 Mission Street," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Elise opened her eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You know where we live!" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Good-evening. Clarence shall
be home in half an hour."</p>

<p>He handed the driver two dollars, and Elise was
taken to her apartments in a luxurious style which
was entirely new to her.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith returned to the gambling-saloon, much
impressed with the modesty and beauty of Elise.</p>

<p>"Decidedly, she is too good for Clarence," he
muttered.</p>

<p>Once again in the gilded saloon of vice he looked
in vain for Clarence among the players.</p>

<p>"Where is the young man who was winning?" he
asked of the dealer.</p>

<p>"He has dropped out," was the answer.</p>

<p>"A loser?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He staked his pile on one card, and somehow
it didn't come up as he expected."</p>

<p>"Fool!" remarked Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>He walked through the suite of handsomely-furnished
rooms to see where Clarence was, because
he could not have left the place, or he would have
been met on the stairs.</p>

<p>In an inner apartment he saw a sight which
startled, though it did not surprise him.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a man of the world, whom it was
difficult to surprise, as it was part of his education
and temperament not to exhibit emotion at anything.</p>

<p>Kneeling before a large mirror, his face pale
and haggard beyond expression, was Clarence
Holt.</p>

<p>In his right hand he held a pistol, and in his left
a photograph of Elise, which he was kissing passionately.</p>

<p>It was a sad picture, and showed to what desperate
straits drink and gambling can reduce their
votaries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Suddenly he dropped the picture and placed the
muzzle of the pistol to his temple.</p>

<p>"God forgive me," he prayed, "and help the
widow and the orphan. Elise, my darling, my life,
my all, farewell."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith rushed forward and knocked up his
arm, so that at this most critical moment in the
young man's career the weapon went off without
injuring him, and the ball lodged in the ceiling.</p>

<p>It was a narrow escape.</p>

<p>"Idiot," cried Smith, "what are you thinking
of?"</p>

<p>Clarence Holt looked repentant and abashed.</p>

<p>"I have spent your money," he replied. "I repulsed
my wife. I am a wretch, unworthy to live."</p>

<p>"Get up and go home."</p>

<p>"Alas! I have no home now. My money is gone
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith interrupted him by allowing to flutter
down at his side a one hundred-dollar bill, giving it to
him as carelessly as one casts a bone to a dog.</p>

<p>"For me!" asked Clarence, eagerly snatching it.</p>

<p>"No, for Elise and your child," was the reply.
"Give it to her. A fellow like you deserves nothing
but a good thrashing."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," answered Clarence, the old,
despairing look coming over him again. "Let me
die."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"If you don't leave off whining," he exclaimed,
"I shall be strongly tempted to kick you!"</p>

<p>Clarence did not move; he picked up his hat and
left the pistol where it had fallen.</p>

<p>"Be a man," continued Mr. Smith. "Don't be
afraid of the world and the world won't hurt you."</p>

<p>Humiliated, and with his head in a whirl, Clarence
quitted the room, and Mr. Smith re-entered the gambling-saloon,
in which was a noisy party of miners
who, having come into town with plenty of money,
could not resist the fascinations of faro.</p>

<p>All at once Mr. Smith was confronted by a man,
who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"So we have met sooner than I expected!"</p>

<p>"Harkaway," repeated the person who called
himself Smith.</p>

<p>"At your service, my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>Jack had met Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>This gentleman was an English nobleman of high
rank and great wealth.</p>

<p>They had met in New York, and both had fallen
in love with a young lady named Lena Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>Lena's brother Alfred wished her to marry Jack,
but her mother, Mrs. Vanhoosen, wished her to
espouse the rich nobleman.</p>

<p>Jack and Lord Maltravers had quarreled about
Lena.</p>

<p>The quarrel took place in a well-known up-town
resort, and Maltravers had fired a pistol at Jack.</p>

<p>The shot missed its mark, but the cowardly nobleman
had to fly to avoid arrest.</p>

<p>He retreated to San Francisco, and Jack, learning
where he had gone, followed him.</p>

<p>They met in the gambling-saloon.</p>

<p>His lordship was perfectly collected after the
first shock of surprise had passed away, and he did
not attempt to escape.</p>

<p>"So you have followed me?" he observed.</p>

<p>"That is an unnecessary question to ask," replied
Jack. "You see I am here."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You might have been making a tour
of California, but since you have declared that you
followed me, may I ask your reason?"</p>

<p>"To bring you to justice for attempting my
life, after which I shall marry Miss Vanhoosen."</p>

<p>"So you have gone into the detective business,
Mr. Harkaway? I congratulate you," said his lordship,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It was time for me to do something."</p>

<p>"Well, you have found me. What next?"</p>

<p>"I shall arrest you."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord. I shall be my own police
officer, and not give you a chance to run away."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "what do you
take me for?"</p>

<p>"Precisely for that which I know you to be."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An unmitigated scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Thank you; personality seems to be your
forte," said Maltravers. "And now let me tell you
one thing: I am no child to be arrested by you."</p>

<p>"We shall see," answered Jack.</p>

<p>The room, as we have said, was full of rough
characters, who were noisy, and inclined to be riotous;
wine was flowing freely.</p>

<p>"Boys!" cried Maltravers, in a stentorian voice.</p>

<p>Instantly he was the centre of attraction.</p>

<p>"Do any of you want to make a stake of a hundred
dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" replied a dozen men.</p>

<p>"Then put a head on this man for me."</p>

<p>He held out five twenty-dollar gold-pieces in one
hand and pointed to Harkaway with the other.</p>

<p>A big man, over six feet high, apparently strong
as a horse, with a well-developed biceps muscle,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>He had several scars on his face, and had lost one
eye, which gave him a ghastly appearance.</p>

<p>"That money's mine," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You can have it if you are my man."</p>

<p>"Hand it over."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers gave him the gold, and at the
same time Jack took a step in advance.</p>

<p>"You shall not escape me in that way," he said.</p>

<p>"Hold on there," cried the volunteer.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid of you," cried Jack.</p>

<p>"I'm Nappa Bill," said the man, "and if I can't
make you squeal, I want to go home."</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said Harkaway. "This fellow
is a notorious murderer, and is wanted in New
York."</p>

<p>"New York be darned!" said Nappa Bill. "If
he has killed his man, there are lots of us in this
room who has done the same thing, and his money
is as good to me as any other chap's. Let him go,
and then you an' me's got to talk."</p>

<p>Seeing that it would be useless to attempt to arrest
his lordship after the turn affairs had taken,
Jack relinquished his idea.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I will leave you to amuse yourselves,"
exclaimed Maltravers.</p>

<p>Jack was furiously indignant, and burned with
rage as he saw his enemy make for the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried.</p>

<p>"To oblige you? Oh, dear, no. I rather think
not. I shall be glad to meet you at Foster's Cliff
House to-morrow at two, if you will promise to come
unattended."</p>

<p>"I will be there."</p>

<p>"On my terms?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well; we can then discuss the situation;
for the present, it will be enough to say good-night."</p>

<p>Always a polished villain, Maltravers bowed and
took his departure.</p>

<p>Jack was baffled, and was about to sit down to
consider what he should do, when Nappa Bill made
a furious lunge at him with a knife.</p>

<p>Seeing the movement, he stepped on one side and
escaped being killed by almost a miracle.</p>

<p>Being armed, he drew a pistol.</p>

<p>"Keep off," he said, "or I'll shoot."</p>

<p>"That's good enough. I like to see a man heeled.
I'll have more pleasure in cutting you now," answered
Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>"What do you want to fight me at all for?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't I paid for it? Why, look at here, I'd
scorn to take the man's money and do nothing for
it."</p>

<p>"Come on, then. The sooner this thing is settled
the better."</p>

<p>Nappa Bill did not want to be asked twice; he accepted
the invitation and threw himself upon Jack,
who received a slight flesh-wound in his shoulder.</p>

<p>Drawing himself quickly back, he fired a snap-shot
at the ruffian, not having time to take aim.</p>

<p>The bullet struck Nappa Bill about the middle of
the wrist, and with a fearful oath he allowed his
knife to drop on the floor.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he cried. "You've broken my
wrist."</p>

<p>"It's all your own fault," replied Jack, coolly.
"I did not provoke this contest, as all the gentlemen
here present, I am sure, will testify. You have
made a little money by your conduct, but I guess it
will all go in doctor's bills."</p>

<p>At this there was a laugh.</p>

<p>Nappa Bill bound up his injured hand with a
napkin, which he snatched from the arm of the
negro waiter.</p>

<p>Looking earnestly at Jack, he said:</p>

<p>"I'm cornered this time, and I'll own up that
you got the best of me, but by thunder, I'll get
square with you, colonel, if it takes me all my
life."</p>

<p>"Ah, pshaw! fellows like you can't harm me."</p>

<p>"Are you betting money on that?"</p>

<p>"I never bet with your class," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"What's my class?" inquired Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>"Loafers, frauds and beats."</p>

<p>"You're kind of high-toned, aren't you?" sneered
Nappa Bill. "They're all gentlemen where you
come from, I should imagine; don't have to work
and look around for a living."</p>

<p>"It matters very little who or what I am," replied
Jack, "but if you pick me up for a fool you'll
find that you never made a greater mistake in your
life."</p>

<p>"That's all right, but remember that Nappa Bill
is your open enemy."</p>

<p>Jack put his pistol back in his pocket, and with a
careless laugh quitted the room.</p>

<p>There were several men standing in his way, but
they quickly made space for him.</p>

<p>Nappa Bill did not attempt to injure him further.
He contented himself with using some strong adjectives,
which would not look well in print.</p>

<p>Harkaway had won the first move in the game.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">MALTRAVERS'S PLOT.</p>


<p>Early on the following day Maltravers presented
himself at Clarence Holt's lodgings, on
Mission Street.</p>

<p>He found the husband and wife at breakfast.</p>

<p>They both rose and welcomed him, though it was
apparent that there was more fear than warmth in
their reception.</p>

<p>"Go on with your breakfast," he said; "don't
mind me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am through," replied Clarence,
who lost all appetite at the sight of the man who
held him in his power; "it is time I started for the
bank."</p>

<p>"You need not trouble yourself about business
to-day."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I want you to do a little work for me."</p>

<p>Elise looked reproachfully at her husband.</p>

<p>"If you neglect your duties you will lose your situation!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I will find him another if that should happen,"
said his lordship. "Can I talk with you alone,
Holt?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>He handed the paper to his wife, and added:</p>

<p>"Go, my dear, to your room, and amuse yourself
with the news until I am at liberty."</p>

<p>Elise, with an ill grace, quitted the room, wondering
what secret business the two men were about
to transact.</p>

<p>With the quick instinct of a woman, who is always
more or less of a disciple of Lavater, and a
judge of male character, she took a dislike to Maltravers
when she had a fair opportunity of studying
his face.</p>

<p>Not that he was homely. Far from it. He was
just the sort of man to fascinate a woman, but there
was a lurking devil in his features which betrayed
the slumbering fire of wickedness within.</p>

<p>Her husband and Mr. Smith were closeted together
for over an hour, when the latter left.</p>

<p>"You fully understand?" said his lordship, at parting.</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"I leave for Calistoga this afternoon, and depend
upon you."</p>

<p>"I will do my best, sir," replied Clarence, respectfully.</p>

<p>Closing the door, he sank into a chair and wiped
the beads of perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"He is not a man," he muttered; "he is a fiend."</p>

<p>Elise had entered the room.</p>

<p>"What is that you say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Clarence, evasively. "I have
to go out. This evening I shall take you to the
theatre."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled with pleasure, for it was not
often that her husband of late had invited her out.</p>

<p>In happier days they were in the habit of going
out together, but now Clarence left her alone with
her baby.</p>

<p>He kissed her with some of the old-time tenderness,
and the act brought the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you would always be like this," she said,
"I should begin to feel happy again."</p>

<p>"The time will come, darling," he answered.</p>

<p>"God grant it. You have been so changed
lately, Clarry. I have thought that you had some
terrible secret on your mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"But tell me, will you not, what influence that
man has over you?"</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith, he who was here with you. What
were you talking about, and why has he kept you
away from your work?"</p>

<p>"Little women should not ask questions," he replied.</p>

<p>With a deep-drawn sigh, Elise turned away to
hide her tears, which flowed afresh, and Clarence
Holt went out.</p>

<p>She felt that there was some awful secret which
he kept concealed from her.</p>

<p>The brief happiness she had experienced was
short-lived, and the heavy sensation which had
oppressed her heart clung round it once more.</p>

<p>Clarence sent a note to the bank, excusing his
absence on the plea of sickness, and going to a
livery stable, hired a wagon and a pair of horses,
with which he drove through the Golden Gate Park
to Captain Foster's Cliff House.</p>

<p>On his way he looked frequently at a photograph
which Maltravers had given him, underneath which
was written the name "Jack Harkaway."</p>

<p>When he reached the Cliff House he put his horse
under the shed and entered the bar-room.</p>

<p>Jack was already there, smoking a cigar by the
window, and looking out at the seals on the rocks
in the sea.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harkaway, I believe," said Clarence.</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," replied Jack. "What
is your business with me?"</p>

<p>"I am commissioned to give you a letter."</p>

<p>Jack took the proffered epistle from his hand, and
tearing open the envelope, read the contents,
which were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I find it impossible to meet you to-day, as appointed,
as I am making preparations to leave San
Francisco at once, but I should like to see you this
evening at the California Theatre. I have Box B.
I will formally give up all claims to a certain lady's
hand, and if you will let me alone I will not molest
you any more.</p>

<p class="right">
"M."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Thank you," said Jack.</p>

<p>"What answer shall I take back?" asked Clarence
Holt.</p>

<p>"Say I will be at the theatre."</p>

<p>He tore the note into fragments, and with a bow
Clarence left him.</p>

<p>Presently he was joined by a tall, stout, florid-looking
man, well dressed, and apparently well-to-do,
who said:</p>

<p>"Fine day."</p>

<p>"Is it?" replied Jack, abstractedly.</p>

<p>"I said it was a fine day, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"You're a Britisher, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Guessed so. Been here long?"</p>

<p>"Really, I don't see how the length of my residence
in this country can possibly interest you,"
said Jack.</p>

<p>"Don't see it, hey?'</p>

<p>"No, I don't, and what is more, I am not in the
habit of talking to strangers."</p>

<p>"Got to get cured of that. However, if you
want an introduction, I'll give it to you. Here's
my card."</p>

<p>Jack glanced at it, and read the name of "Captain
Blower."</p>

<p>Out of politeness he exchanged cards with him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harkaway, I'm glad to know you," said the
captain. "I'm a Forty-niner, and you can bet I'm
solid."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" remarked Jack, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I own real estate, and I'm interested
in a mine. How do you like our climate?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good in the morning, but rather cold and
dusty in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"What do you think of our seals?"</p>

<p>These are the two first questions that San Franciscans
always ask strangers.</p>

<p>"Oh, the seals didn't strike me as being anything
wonderful," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Aren't, eh?"</p>

<p>"They seem quiet, inoffensive-looking creatures
as they lie on the rocks basking in the sun."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you wouldn't care to swim out and bring
one back," exclaimed Captain Blower.</p>

<p>"Oh! That would be easy enough."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you."</p>

<p>"My dear Sir, I don't want to make a show of
myself, or I'd do it in a moment."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you," said Captain Blower, a third time.</p>

<p>Harkaway grew irritated at his persistence.</p>

<p>"What will you bet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"I don't like to take your money."</p>

<p>"There is more where that came from. You
dursn't do it."</p>

<p>"Put it up," said Jack, promptly.</p>

<p>The captain walked over to a military-looking
gentleman, and producing a roll of bills, counted
out five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"Foster!" he exclaimed to the proprietor of the
Cliff House, "you know me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should hope so," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I've bet this gentleman, Mr. Harkaway, five
hundred that he can't swim out to the rocks and
bring back a seal, and I want you to hold the
stakes."</p>

<p>"I'll do it. But does the gentleman know that
it's the breeding-season, and the seals are dangerous
at this time of the year?"</p>

<p>Harkaway approached and handed over his
money.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter!" he exclaimed. "I'm
willing to accept the bet. All I want is a bathing-suit
and a sharp knife. That's fair, I hope."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Foster.</p>

<p>"I don't object," replied Captain Blower.</p>

<p>"You see that big fellow half way up the biggest
rock?" continued Jack, pointing to the sea.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is the one we call General Butler."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll undertake to bring him back, although
I might win the bet by carrying off one of
the small seals."</p>

<p>Foster admired his courage, but doubted his
ability to carry out his determination.</p>

<p>He took Jack into a bedroom, where he donned a
bathing-suit and was given a carving-knife, which
was the most formidable weapon they had in the
house.</p>

<p>Thus provided he walked down to the seaside by
himself, while Foster and Captain Blower, armed
with opera-glasses, sat on chairs on the piazza and
watched his progress.</p>

<p>Jack was an excellent swimmer, and plunging
into the sea, swam rapidly toward the seal-rocks.</p>

<p>He carried the knife between his teeth.</p>

<p>The seals, who could be numbered by hundreds,
had crept out of the sea and were lying in various
places on the rocks, apparently asleep.</p>

<p>Some must have been awake, however, for every
now and then a loud bark was heard.</p>

<p>What Captain Foster had said about the seals
being dangerous was perfectly true.</p>

<p>They had been bearing young, and were perfectly
ready to repel any invasion of their territory.</p>

<p>This Jack did not know.</p>

<p>No one ever interfered with them, as it is a
penal offense to shoot them, they being one of the
shows of the city.</p>

<p>What would San Francisco be without its seals?</p>

<p>A pleasant swim of from ten to fifteen minutes' duration
brought him to the largest of the three rocks.</p>

<p>The seals began to bark, and some dived into the
water.</p>

<p>To climb up was very difficult, as the seaweed
was wet and slippery, it being ebb tide.</p>

<p>One seal attempted to bite him, but a dexterous
thrust with his knife gave the sea-lion his death-blow.</p>

<p>With praiseworthy perseverance Jack got up to
where the big seal was disporting himself in the rays
of the sun.</p>

<p>The animal showed its gleaming tusks and snapped
at Jack's leg, missing it by half an inch.</p>

<p>Jack stooped down and tried to stab the huge
beast, but his foot slipped, and he rolled over and
over until he fell with a loud splash into the sea.</p>

<p>The seal had also lost its balance, and came toppling
over on the top of him.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Jack had retained his hold of the
knife.</p>

<p>When he rose to the surface, he found himself
confronted by a dozen angry seals, and for some
time a lively fight ensued.</p>

<p>The sea was stained with blood, and Jack received
some bites, more or less severe, but not
serious enough to disable him.</p>

<p>At length, by a dexterous thrust, he killed the
huge seal he had at first singled out as his prey.</p>

<p>It keeled over, and grasping one of its fins, he
dragged it laboriously to the shore, swimming with
one hand.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" said Captain Blower, "I reckoned
those critters would have chawed him up."</p>

<p>"It's his good luck they did not," replied Mr. Foster,
lowering his opera-glass.</p>

<p>Clarence Holt had been one of the spectators of
this singular scene.</p>

<p>"You are five hundred dollars out," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care for that. A friend of mine,
Mr. Smith, gave it me to speculate with," replied
Captain Blower, smiling significantly.</p>

<p>Clarence was much surprised at this declaration.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with Mr. Smith?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Anything funny about that? It's not an
uncommon name, is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, but I happen to be employed by the
same gentleman, that is all," answered Clarence;
"and all I can say is, if Smith's agents are so
numerous, I shouldn't like to be Jack Harkaway."</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Captain Blower. "It would
tickle me to death to hold an insurance on his life."</p>

<p>Clarence, after this, drove off, more than ever
impressed with the power and resources of his employer.</p>

<p>In time Jack appeared with his captive, which
Mr. Foster said he would have stuffed in commemoration
of the event.</p>

<p>Jack took a bath, plastered up his bites, and did
not feel any the worse for his exploit.</p>

<p>Captain Blower paid the money and hurried
away, as if he had other work to attend to.</p>

<p>Jack had ridden over, and calling for his horse,
mounted and rode toward the Golden Gate Park.</p>

<p>Soon afterward a buggy came up behind him at
a quick pace.</p>

<p>In it was Captain Blower, who gave utterance to
a whoop which would have done credit to a Piute
Indian on the war-path.</p>

<p>This cry startled Jack's horse, which started off
at top speed.</p>

<p>Jack endeavored to rein him in, but the bridle
broke, and he was utterly powerless to control or
guide the maddened animal.</p>

<p>Some one had evidently tampered with the rein,
half cutting it in two.</p>

<p>The gate of the park was drawing near, and Jack
became very nervous, for if he got thrown on the
hard road he would be killed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the horse swerved and dashed across
the sand-hills on the left, plowing up to his knees,
and greatly diminishing his speed.</p>

<p>At length his rider saw a chance of throwing himself
off in a soft place, and did so.</p>

<p>The horse came to a stop a little further on.</p>

<p>Jack walked up and examined the bridle, which,
as he suspected, had been cut.</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers's agents again. I cannot trust
that man," he muttered. "It will be best to have
him arrested to-night, at the theatre. I do not see
why I should keep faith with him."</p>

<p>Mending the rein he walked the horse home, and
at the hotel found his two old friends, Mr. Mole and
Harvey, whom he had left in New York, and who
had just arrived.</p>

<p>The professor walked with a stick, being yet a
little lame.</p>

<p>Harvey was the bearer of a long letter and many
kind messages from Lena Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to Jack to see his friends,
to whom he related what had happened since his
arrival in San Francisco.</p>

<p>"By all means arrest Maltravers at the theatre
to-night," said Harvey, "and put a stop to his intrigues,
once for all."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Suppose I come in at the end of the first act
and bring a police officer with me?"</p>

<p>"That will do," answered Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole had gone outside in the corridor, and
all at once Jack and Harvey heard a great uproar.</p>

<p>They rushed out, and found the professor attacking
a man with his crutch.</p>

<p>"Hold on, sir!" cried Jack. "What is all this
about?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mole stopped beating the man, who instantly
ran away.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it, Jack," said Mr. Mole. "I'm
an old man and my nerves are weak."</p>

<p>"What has occurred to ruffle your feathers?"</p>

<p>"I have only been half a day in San Francisco,
and this man whom I was chastising asked me, for
the twentieth time, how I liked the climate and what
I thought of the seals."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Jack.</p>

<p>"It may be very funny, but there is a limit to
human endurance," replied the professor, shaking
his head, dismally.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's nothing when you get used to it," Jack
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole retired to his room, evidently laboring
under the impression that he had been badly used,
and Harkaway went out with Harvey to promenade
on Montgomery Street.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE BOX AT THE CALIFORNIA THEATRE.</p>


<p>It was quite a gala night at the theatre, and every
seat was taken.</p>

<p>The prima donna of an English Opera Company
which had been delighting
the town took a benefit.</p>

<p>Soon after the curtain
rose Harkaway, in evening
dress, sought the
seclusion of Box B, to
which he was shown by
the usher.</p>

<p>"Any one inside?"
asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Only a lady, sir,"
replied the usher, with
a sly smile.</p>

<p>"A lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Surely there must be
some mistake. I expected
to meet a gentleman."</p>

<p>"This is Box B," the
usher said, opening the
door.</p>

<p>Jack entered and
bowed to a very pretty
young lady, who was no
other than Elise Holt.</p>

<p>She had been placed
in the box by her husband,
who had gone
away, telling her that he
had a little business to
attend to, but would return
shortly.</p>

<p>The opera was
"Faust," which Elise
liked very much, but she
did not seem to be paying
much attention to
Gounod's music.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon
if I am intruding," exclaimed
Jack. "I was
invited here by a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You are expected,
if you are Mr. Harkaway,"
replied Elise.</p>

<p>"I am that individual."</p>

<p>Elise rose and came
hastily to the back of the
box.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she said,
"do not think ill of me.
I owe a duty to my
husband, and also one
to you, though you are
a stranger to me."</p>

<p>"Really, madam, I am
at a loss to understand
you," answered Harkaway,
in some perplexity.</p>

<p>"You have an enemy."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a very bitter
one."</p>

<p>"I know all. Let me
be brief. If I do not make
myself understood it is
because I am agitated,"
said Elise. "You are
brought here to-night in
order to be ruined. Let
me beg of you to fly."</p>

<p>Jack smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied.
"That is not my way of
doing things at all."</p>

<p>"You refuse?"</p>

<p>"Most distinctly. I
must see this thing out."</p>

<p>"Then I am powerless
to help you," said Elise,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," exclaimed Jack, "I
know I am living in the midst of danger, and you
said so much that I have the strongest wish to hear
more."</p>

<p>"Every moment is precious."</p>

<p>"Why waste any time, then? You seem to take
an interest in me."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed. Oh! what shall I do?" cried
Elise.</p>

<p>They were still standing at the back of the box,
so that no one could see them, and the crash of the
music prevented their voices from being heard.</p>

<p>"Speak! No one ever regretted telling the
truth," said Jack; "and I can see by your face that
you are too good a young lady to wish to conceal
anything you ought to
reveal."</p>

<p>Elise suddenly made
up her mind.</p>

<p>"I will save you, if
possible," she said.
"Listen. I have heard
my husband talking to a
stranger. My husband is
a clerk in a bank; he
has committed forgeries
to enable him to gamble.
These forgeries are held
by Mr. Smith, alias Lord
Maltravers, who is your
enemy."</p>

<p>"Ha!" ejaculated
Harkaway.</p>

<p>"You expected to
meet Lord Maltravers
here this evening," pursued
Elise.</p>

<p>"Candidly, you are
right."</p>

<p>"He is gone to the
Geysers to make terms
with Vasquez, the bandit,
to kidnap you."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"You are to be shipped
to Rio de Janeiro,
where for the remainder
of your days you will
work as a slave in the
diamond mines of Brazil."</p>

<p>"But how is all this to
be done, my dear girl?"
asked Jack, smiling.</p>

<p>"I know not; they
have their plans all made
up. It is horrible."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No. You love Miss
Lena Vanhoosen, in New
York?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, my husband
will come in presently."</p>

<p>"In here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in this box, and
accuse you of flirting
with me. He will raise
a disturbance. You are
to be arrested. The case
will be in all the papers
to-morrow, and Miss
Vanhoosen will be told
that you are unfaithful
to your vows."</p>

<p>Jack whistled.</p>

<p>Though Elise spoke
quickly, and her story
was disconnected in
parts, it was, nevertheless,
intelligible enough.</p>

<p>His enemy was actively
at work.</p>

<p>"I thank you, very
much," said he. "I am
a thousand times obliged
to you. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night. It is
not safe for you to stay
here."</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"You will not reveal
what I have told you?"
pleaded Elise.</p>

<p>"Not for worlds."</p>

<p>"They would kill me
if they only knew."</p>

<p>Jack went to the door
of the box and was
about to depart, when
he saw Elise's handkerchief lying on the floor. Always
gallant, and quite a ladies' man, he stooped
and picked it up.</p>

<p>"Your handkerchief, I think," he said; "allow
me to return it."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" replied Elise.</p>

<p>He was about to give it to her, when the door of
the box opened and Clarence Holt entered.</p>

<p>The latter pretended to be profoundly astonished.</p>

<p>"Elise!" he exclaimed, "who is this man?"</p>

<p>The poor girl, terribly frightened, sank into a
seat.</p>

<p>"Answer me!" continued Clarence, "I insist
upon it, for it is my right."</p>

<p>Jack stepped up to him.</p>

<p>"You need not continue this farce, sir!" he said,
"for you know perfectly well that my name is
Harkaway, for you met me at the Cliff House this
morning."</p>

<p>"I deny it. I never saw you before in my life,
and I want you to be good enough to explain how
it is that I find you alone in a private box with my
wife?"</p>

<p>"I shall give you no explanation."</p>

<p>"But I will have one," blustered Clarence.</p>

<p>"Ask Lord Maltravers," said Jack.</p>

<p>Clarence stepped back at this shot.</p>

<p>"Subterfuges will not avail you, sir," he replied.
"This is my wife's handkerchief you hold in your
hand. You are a villain and a trickster!"</p>

<p>"No man shall call me that," cried Jack.</p>

<p>He raised his fist and knocked Clarence down,
which was precisely what that pliant tool of Lord
Maltravers wanted.</p>

<p>Elise shrieked.</p>

<p>The attention of the whole house was quickly
transferred to the occupants of Box B.</p>

<p>"Help! help!" shouted Clarence.</p>

<p>Two policemen who had been stationed outside
now entered and seized Jack.</p>

<p>At the same time a newspaper reporter, who had
also been told to be on hand, made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Arrest that man!" said Clarence. "I charge
him with assaulting me, because I tried to protect
my honor."</p>

<p>"I protest," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>The policeman, already heavily bribed, dragged
him away to the station-house.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" asked the reporter.</p>

<p>"I will tell you presently," replied Clarence.</p>

<p>To add to the confusion, Elise had fainted.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">VASQUEZ, THE BANDIT.</p>


<p>Harkaway was merely taken to the station-house
and kept there half an hour.</p>

<p>This was all the indignity he was subjected to.</p>

<p>After this he was discharged, as no one came to
make any complaint against him.</p>

<p>All Lord Maltravers wanted was the scene in the
theatre, the scandal of which could be made into a
very pretty story for the newspapers.</p>

<p>Harkaway's escapade, as it would be called,
could be sent to Miss Vanhoosen, and her mind be
poisoned by reading how Jack was caught in a box
at the theatre with another man's wife.</p>

<p>This was part of his deep-laid plot.</p>

<p>Jack returned to the Palace Hotel, where Mr.
Mole and Harvey were awaiting him.</p>

<p>They could not help laughing when they heard
how Maltravers had succeeded in tricking him,
after all.</p>

<p>"Never mind; there will be no harm done,"
said the professor. "You can write to Miss Vanhoosen,
and your word will go further than anything
he can say."</p>

<p>"It isn't what he can say," exclaimed Jack; "it's
what the papers will print."</p>

<p>"Hang the papers!" growled Harvey.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Jack, "Maltravers will
send the papers to Lena, and you all know what
women think of anything in print."</p>

<p>"It's a dirty, mean trick of Maltravers," said
Harvey.</p>

<p>"So it is; but what if he carries out the rest of
his programme, as the girl in the box described
it, and sends our friend Jack to the Brazils?"</p>

<p>"I should look well as a galley slave," remarked
Jack, laughing.</p>

<p>"It is no laughing matter," continued Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"We won't leave him," said Harvey. "He
shan't go out alone."</p>

<p>This being settled, they retired to rest.</p>

<p>The morning papers fully realized Jack's expectations,
for they contained full and sensational accounts
of the disturbance at the California Theatre.</p>

<p>Names were freely given, and the affair aroused
the liveliest interest.</p>

<p>In vain Jack wrote letters explanatory of the occurrence.
The papers would not insert them, so
the lie went forth uncontradicted, and Maltravers
was triumphant.</p>

<p>While Jack was chewing the cud of bitter reflection,
he received a letter bearing the Calistoga
postmark.</p>

<p>It was signed "Anonymous," and stated the following:</p>

<p>"If Mr. Harkaway wishes to meet Lord Maltravers,
he can find him at the Geysers, in Northern
California. Go to Fossville from Calistoga and you
will find fresh instructions awaiting you, with Four-in-Hand
Foss."</p>

<p>"Look at this," said Jack, handing the letter to
Harvey.</p>

<p>Dick read it and replied:</p>

<p>"Queer! Who the deuce is Four-in-Hand Foss?"</p>

<p>"I'll find out, for I'll start for Calistoga to-day."</p>

<p>Mr. Mole entered at this juncture.</p>

<p>"And what will you go to Calistoga for?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Jack read him the letter.</p>

<p>"It's a trap, my dear friend," replied the professor.</p>

<p>"Trap or no trap, I'm going," answered Jack.</p>

<p>He rang the bell and called his black servant,
Monday.</p>

<p>"What's in de wind now, sah?" asked Monday.</p>

<p>"Pack up. We are going to start for the North."</p>

<p>That afternoon they crossed the bay in the
steamer, and taking the steam-cars, reached Calistoga
by nightfall.</p>

<p>In the morning they were surprised to hear that
"Four-in-Hand Foss" was waiting outside their
hotel.</p>

<p>Harkaway went down-stairs and asked to see Mr.
Foss.</p>

<p>He was shown a tall, handsome man, between
fifty and sixty years of age, who is well-known to
every tourist on the Pacific Slope.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Foss," said Jack, after the introduction
was effected, "to what am I indebted for the
honor of this visit?"</p>

<p>"I heard you had arrived," replied Foss, "and
that you intended to visit the Geysers. I own the
road over the mountains, and I reckoned I'd drive
you myself."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"You're welcome."</p>

<p>"Have you any message for me?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"You're Harkaway, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I was told to tell you that you would meet
the man you are in search of in the hills."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Foss, "he's a fellow I've met
around considerable, and he is called Nappa Bill."</p>

<p>"Nappa Bill!" repeated Jack. "That's the fellow
I shot in San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;he wears one arm in a sling," replied
Foss, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Will you breakfast with me?" perused Jack.</p>

<p>"I'll take a cocktail. Fact is, I'm not much on
eating to-day."</p>

<p>"Why not? Has anything occurred to take away
your appetite, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I'm in mourning for a five-hundred dollar horse
that died of the glanders, yesterday, and it isn't ten
to one that I don't spill you out of the coach before
I get you up the hill."</p>

<p>Jack invited him into the breakfast-room and introduced
him to his companions.</p>

<p>When they had eaten something they got into the
stage, which was drawn by six horses.</p>

<p>Foss was the best driver in California, and the way
in which he handled a team was quite fascinating
to Jack, who could "handle the ribbons" and
"tool a pair of tits" as well as the next one.</p>

<p>The distance between Calistoga and Fossville was
completed in about twenty-five minutes, the stage
rolling about in the most alarming manner.</p>

<p>It was arranged they should stay for lunch, and
Mr. Foss indulged in further demonstrations of grief
for the five-hundred dollar horse.</p>

<p>That is to say, he drank enough champagne to
float an ordinary rowing-boat.</p>

<p>At one o'clock they started to ascend the mountains
on their way to the Geysers.</p>

<p>Harkaway was perfectly charmed by the magnificent
scenery which he saw on all sides.</p>

<p>So engrossed was he in contemplating the wonders
of nature that he did not see a man spring out
in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Nor did he notice half a dozen men form in line
behind the stage.</p>

<p>These held blocks of stone in their hands, and
when Foss brought his horses to a standstill, they
placed the stones behind the wheels to prevent the
stage slipping down hill.</p>

<p>They were fully armed with rifles and pistols;
knives peeped out of their belts, and their faces
wore an air of ferocious determination.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried the leader.</p>

<p>It was at this command that Foss stopped his
horses.</p>

<p>The leader wore his arm in a sling, and Harkaway
had no difficulty in recognizing the familiar
features of Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>"Throw up your arms," continued the leader.</p>

<p>Jack looked round and saw that they were surrounded.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" he asked of Foss.</p>

<p>"Got to weaken," replied Foss.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole appeared very indignant and drew a
pistol, which he discharged at Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>The bullet missed the mark, and Bill laughed
loudly.</p>

<p>"Put up your iron, you old fool," he said; "we
only want Jack Harkaway out of your crowd, and
if we don't have him step down and out, right
away, there'll be a circus here, with some dead
bodies in it, mighty quick."</p>

<p>"Look at here," replied Foss. "I don't want
people to think that I'm in this thing. You give
me a message to take to Calistoga for you to this
gentleman, Mr. Harkaway, and that's all there is in
it."</p>

<p>"That is true, Foss; you are as square as they
make them."</p>

<p>"Let us go on, then."</p>

<p>"Not till Harkaway gets out."</p>

<p>Harvey now leveled his pistol at Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>"You scoundrel," he said; "take that."</p>

<p>As before, the bullet flew wide of the mark.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Nappa Bill; "the ball isn't
molded yet that can hit me."</p>

<p>Just then some one fired from behind, and Harvey
fell into the stage with a bullet in his shoulder.</p>

<p>"My God, I'm hit!" he cried.</p>

<p>Jack rose up.</p>

<p>"We are overpowered," he exclaimed. "I do
not wish my friends to suffer for my sake."</p>

<p>"Surrender!" said Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>Jack deliberately walked over to the man and
threw down his pistol.</p>

<p>"This is a civilized State," he said. "You
daren't murder me. Let my friends go on, and I
will become your prisoner, for I know that there
will be such a hue and cry in a day or two that
California will be too hot to hold you."</p>

<p>"That's what you say," replied the robber, mockingly.</p>

<p>Harkaway folded his arms and stood his ground.</p>

<p>"Drive on, Foss," said the robber.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce are you, anyway?" asked Four-in-Hand
Foss.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know, particularly?"</p>

<p>"If I didn't I shouldn't ask."</p>

<p>The robber drew himself up proudly to his full
height.</p>

<p>"I am Vasquez, the bandit," he cried.</p>

<p>Foss indulged in a prolonged whistle.</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" he said, hitting his horses. "Git
up thar. That settles it. I didn't count on meeting
with Vasquez."</p>

<p>"No hard feelings, old man," cried Vasquez,
who had concealed his identity under the name of
Nappa Bill.</p>

<p>"Not at all, pard. So long."</p>

<p>The horses started, and the stage went on up the
hill.</p>

<p>Harkaway was in the custody of Vasquez and his
men, while Mr. Mole, half frightened to death, and
Harvey, dangerously wounded, were slowly carried
away, it not being in the power of Foss to prevent
this consummation.</p>

<p>Jack turned smilingly to his captor, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Vasquez, if that is your name, what
are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir," replied Vasquez, the celebrated
bandit, about whose crimes the whole of California
was excited, "I will allow some one else to answer
that question."</p>

<p>A man stepped forward.</p>

<p>He had been concealed in the bush hitherto,
but directly Jack saw him he recognized Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harkaway," said Maltravers, "you have
kindly fallen into the little trap I laid for you. It
is with great pleasure that I meet you again, and I
shall now send you on a trip which will take you to
South America."</p>

<p>Jack turned pale.</p>

<p>He saw how foolish he had been to despise the
power of his lordship.</p>

<p>"What mean you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Simply that you are on your way to the diamond
mines of Brazil."</p>

<p>"You cannot be in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Never more so in my life, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Villain!"</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers twirled his mustache.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, complacently, "I am all that
the word implies."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot waste time in talking to you. Pray
excuse me," interrupted Maltravers.</p>

<p>Vasquez, the bandit, took hold of Jack's arm and
led him away.</p>

<p>Six men with pistols leveled followed on each
side.</p>

<p>Escape was impossible.</p>

<p>Lower down in the road a stage was in waiting,
and it conveyed the party in two days to the coast.</p>

<p>Jack was put on board a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>The captain was named Moreland.</p>

<p>"You have your orders?" said Vasquez to Moreland.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the captain; "my instructions are
in writing."</p>

<p>"See that they are fulfilled to the letter."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Vasquez left the ship, and Harkaway was confined
in the captain's cabin, where he could amuse
himself with books and papers.</p>

<p>That afternoon the ship sailed, and Jack was
bound for a long voyage.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers was triumphant again.</p>

<p>Jack now blamed himself for yielding so easily,
but he reflected that if he had made any resistance
his whole party would have been killed.</p>

<p>The odds against them were too great.</p>

<p>Wondering if Harvey was much hurt, and consoling
himself with the reflection that his friends knew
where to look for him, he lighted a cigar which he
found on the table, and waited for Captain Moreland
to come to him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE SLAVE OF THE DIAMOND MINES.</p>


<p>The ship on which Jack Harkaway was a prisoner
took out a general cargo for the Brazils.</p>

<p>Captain Moreland at once put Jack at his ease.</p>

<p>He assured him that there was no reason why he
should be treated harshly.</p>

<p>The vessel had not been two hours at sea before
he requested his presence in his cabin.</p>

<p>Jack was not in an enviable position, nor was he
in an amicable frame of mind, but he felt that he
was in the captain's power, and it would be advisable
for him to treat him with civility.</p>

<p>The colored steward placed a couple of bottles
with glasses on the table, as well as a box of cigars,
and retired.</p>

<p>"Be seated," said the captain. "You smoke, I
presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Help yourself," continued Moreland, pushing
the box of cigars over to him. "The wine is port and
sherry; which do you prefer?"</p>

<p>Jack liked sherry, and they pledged one another.</p>

<p>He now had a good opportunity of looking at
Moreland, who was a spare, short man, with reddish
hair and small, twinkling eyes, which appeared
to have a treacherous expression.</p>

<p>"I wish to have you as my friend and companion
during our voyage," began Moreland.</p>

<p>"Nothing would give me greater pleasure," replied
Jack.</p>

<p>"Of course I need not conceal anything from
you?"</p>

<p>"It is useless."</p>

<p>"Well, I admit that I have been paid handsomely
by Vasquez, the bandit, to convey you to Rio. He,
I believe, was employed by some enemy of yours."</p>

<p>"Precisely. I know all that."</p>

<p>"I shall enjoy your society during the voyage, for
I see you are an educated gentleman, and your
companionship cannot fail to be agreeable."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment," exclaimed
Jack, who could not help thinking that there was
something lurking behind this extraordinary civility.</p>

<p>"When you arrive at Rio our intimacy ceases, for
I shall discharge cargo, take in another of bags of
coffee, and return to 'Frisco."</p>

<p>"Am I to be set free then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Moreland.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand that."</p>

<p>"It is simple enough. Your enemy wishes to get
you out of the way for a time. That is all."</p>

<p>"I heard," said Jack, "that I was, in some mysterious
way, to be sent as a slave to the diamond
mines."</p>

<p>"Not by me, at all events," laughed the captain.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. My instructions are simply to land
you at Rio, and there will end my duty as regards
you."</p>

<p>Jack could not make this out.</p>

<p>He was forced, however, to be content with the
assurance given him by Captain Moreland, and there
the conversation ended.</p>

<p>There were plenty of books in the cabin. He
messed with Moreland. Everything he wanted was
placed at his service, and he really had a very pleasant
voyage round Cape Horn.</p>

<p>The captain succeeded in thoroughly gaining his
confidence, and he soon voted him an excellent fellow,
from whom he would be sorry to part when
the time came.</p>

<p>At length Rio was reached, and as Jack was almost
without money, Moreland volunteered to advance
him some for current expenses, taking in
return a sight draft on his agent in San Francisco.</p>

<p>When the ship swung into the dock, and the bills
of lading had been given to the consignees, Moreland
invited Jack to dine with him.</p>

<p>"I know the city," he remarked, "and can take
you to a good place."</p>

<p>Jack accepted the invitation, and they walked
out together.</p>

<p>As they quitted the ship, the captain slipped something
into Harkaway's pocket, without the action
being perceived.</p>

<p>They walked to the restaurant indicated by Moreland,
and Jack's suspicions returned as he saw it
was in a low part of the town.</p>

<p>What was his professed friend's object in steering
him toward the slums, as he was evidently
doing?</p>

<p>"Not a very savory neighborhood, this," he ventured
to observe.</p>

<p>"No, but you will be amply compensated, my
friend, by the cooking, at the little hotel we are in
search of."</p>

<p>"Oh, I comprehend," said Jack. "I am prepared
to sacrifice a great deal for artistic cooking."</p>

<p>They soon reached a dingy-looking inn, where the
waiters and landlord nodded familiarly to the captain,
as if he was an old customer.</p>

<p>The room into which they were ushered was
dark and dirty, the table-cloths uninviting, and directly
Jack saw the place he had an admonition of
coming evil.</p>

<p>"Really," he remarked, "this is as bad as Zola's
<i>Assommoir</i>. I can't congratulate you on your
taste."</p>

<p>"Wait a while," responded Moreland. "Landlord,
a bottle of wine, and the best dinner you can
get ready."</p>

<p>"Si, signor," replied the proprietor, who was a
swarthy, thick-set, beetle-browed Spaniard.</p>

<p>The wine was produced, and seemed to Jack to
have a peculiar flavor.</p>

<p>Being thirsty, he drank heartily of it, while Moreland
contented himself with sipping it.</p>

<p>"You don't drink?" observed Harkaway.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I rarely do before eating; it takes
away my appetite."</p>

<p>A dizziness began to attack Jack, and a soft, sensuous,
dreamy feeling stole over him.</p>

<p>What could it mean?</p>

<p>Had he been brought into the place by his kind
friend, the captain, to be drugged and betrayed into
some carefully set trap?</p>

<p>Indeed, it looked like it.</p>

<p>"What is the time?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"I have no watch," replied Jack. "Vasquez
kindly relieved me of that trifle in the Nappa Valley."</p>

<p>"I had mine when I left the ship," continued
Moreland, "and I have been with no one but you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>It appeared as if there was some latent accusation
in this remark.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," answered the captain. "I have
to report to the American Consul at three, and it is
necessary that I should know the time."</p>

<p>He began to search in all his pockets.</p>

<p>Jack watched him with an abstracted air, while
his stupor increased, and it seemed all the time as
if it was too much trouble for him to speak.</p>

<p>"Very odd where that watch of mine is gone to,"
continued Moreland.</p>

<p>"Very," ejaculated Harkaway.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have not taken it?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>Jack was dumbfounded with astonishment, and
could only stare at Moreland.</p>

<p>"I must have this investigated," said the latter.
"Waiter!"</p>

<p>"Signor?"</p>

<p>"Call an officer&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Jack was like one in a dream.</p>

<p>He could not believe that what he heard was
real.</p>

<p>Some insidious drug had been mixed with the
wine, and like the opium-eater, he was seeing and
hearing things that did not exist.</p>

<p>Presently the waiter returned with a policeman.</p>

<p>"Who wants me?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I do. Arrest and search that man. I accuse
him of stealing my watch."</p>

<p>He pointed to Harkaway, whom the officer approached.</p>

<p>Jack endeavored to rise and strike his false
friend, but he seemed to have lost all power over
his limbs.</p>

<p>Obscured as his intellect was, however, by the
drugged wine, he saw that he was the victim of an
infamous plot, the depth of which, as yet, he could
scarcely gauge.</p>

<p>Moreland had won his confidence to prevent his
making a charge of abduction against him on their
arrival in Rio.</p>

<p>That was clear enough.</p>

<p>What was to follow remained for coming events
to develop.</p>

<p>The officer began to search Jack, who laughed
in a half imbecile manner, as if it was a good joke,
and made no resistance.</p>

<p>In his coat pocket were found a watch and chain.</p>

<p>"Is that yours?" asked the officer, holding it up.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will swear to it. Besides, my name is
on the case. It was a present to me. Oh! the ingratitude
of some people!"</p>

<p>"Shall I arrest the thief?"</p>

<p>"Yes; lock him up. I will follow and make the
complaint."</p>

<p>Jack was dragged rudely from the room to the
police court, which was not far off.</p>

<p>Captain Moreland hastily settled the bill and
followed his victim.</p>

<p>A magistrate was sitting on the bench, and Jack
soon had a specimen of how swiftly justice is administered
in Brazil.</p>

<p>Moreland told his story, stating how he had given
the prisoner a passage from San Francisco, and how
he had returned his kindness by stealing his watch,
while under the influence of liquor.</p>

<p>"He is drunk now," he added, "or perhaps he
would not have done it."</p>

<p>"Do you press the charge?" asked the court.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to society to do so."</p>

<p>Turning to the prisoner, the court asked him if he
had anything to say.</p>

<p>Jack was more and more under the influence of
the drug, whose effects made themselves felt in a
greater degree every minute.</p>

<p>He thought he was dreaming, and continued to
laugh at what he thought was an excellent joke.</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"I shall sentence you to five years' hard labor in
the mines!" exclaimed the magistrate.</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied Jack; "I knew that
was coming."</p>

<p>He laughed louder than ever.</p>

<p>The jailer took him to a cell and locked him up.
He soon fell into a profound slumber, from which
he did not awake until the following morning.</p>

<p>Captain Moreland was perfectly satisfied, for he
fulfilled his contract with his employer to the
letter.</p>

<p>There was no chance of his victim's being pardoned,
and little of his escaping.</p>

<p>Practically, he was out of the way for five years,
during which time Lord Maltravers could prosecute
his plans with regard to Miss Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hardships he would encounter in the
mines might enfeeble his magnificent physique, and
kill him before his sentence expired.</p>

<p>When Jack woke up in his cell he pressed his
hand to his aching head and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where the deuce am I?"</p>

<p>He sat up and reflected.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," he continued, "I had a dream.
Moreland invited me to dine; accused me of stealing
his watch. Hang his impudence! I was arrested,
and got five years in the mines. <i>Was</i> it a
dream?"</p>

<p>A look at the cell convinced him that it was not
so much a dream as a terrible reality.</p>

<p>The perspiration broke out all over him, and he
began to feel terribly alarmed.</p>

<p>Presently the jailer entered with a suit of convict's
clothes and some breakfast.</p>

<p>"Eat and dress," he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Jack; "but let me ask you
a few questions."</p>

<p>"Be brief."</p>

<p>"Am I a convict?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"Is there no appeal? Cannot I communicate
with the English or American Consul?"</p>

<p>"No time for that," replied the jailer. "In half
an hour the chain-gang starts for the mines, and
you are one of them."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, do something for me!"</p>

<p>The jailer shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am innocent," asseverated Jack.</p>

<p>"The stolen property was found on you. It is a
clear case. An angel could not save you."</p>

<p>"But I assure you, my friend, that I am innocent.
It is a base conspiracy of which I am the
victim."</p>

<p>"Eat and dress!" said the jailer, harshly. "In
half an hour I shall come and fix the chain on you."</p>

<p>With these words he banged to the door with a
hollow, sepulchral sound, which to Jack sounded
like the knell of doom.</p>

<p>He recognized the fact that he was indeed a
slave.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "I must admit it was
cleverly done; to repine is useless. I will make
the best of the situation. Harvey, if not mortally
wounded, will come after me. Thanks to what
Elise said, my friends know where I am."</p>

<p>He deliberately ate his breakfast, and then attired
himself in the hideous yellow suit of a convict
sent to the mines.</p>

<p>In the present there was no hope.</p>

<p>It was to the future that he had to look for comfort,
assistance and freedom.</p>

<p>Many were the wild tales he had heard of the sufferings
in the mines by the poor creatures condemned
to toil there.</p>

<p>His heart sank within him as he recalled these
stories.</p>

<p>Yet in the midst of all his misery the fairy-like
form of Lena Vanhoosen would come before him.</p>

<p>She seemed to be ever bidding him hope on, and
telling him that it is always darkest before dawn.</p>

<p>When the half hour was up the jailer, relentless
as fate itself, appeared, and fastened a chain around
his ankle.</p>

<p>In the court-yard of the prison twenty unfortunates,
similarly situated, were assembled.</p>

<p>They were all chained together, and at the word
"March," the gate was thrown open and they
slowly filed out.</p>

<p>Part of the journey was performed by railway,
the convicts having a special car, but a considerable
distance had to be traversed on foot, and this
was painful and toilsome.</p>

<p>Every week the ranks of the miners, depleted by
sickness and death, were reinforced by fresh batches
of criminals.</p>

<p>It was seldom that a mine slave lasted longer
than five years.</p>

<p>The wretches, cruelly tasked and badly fed, broke
down and perished miserably.</p>

<p>The government worked the mines for its own
benefit, entirely by convict labor, and made a handsome
profit out of it, for the labor cost them nothing
but what they paid for food, and often
diamonds of large size, first water, and great value
were found when the mines were reached. The
prisoners were detailed to certain sections, and
Jack had to work underground with a desperate-looking
ruffian whose name was Alfonso.</p>

<p>The most favored prisoners worked above ground,
receiving the "dirt" as it came up the shafts, and
washing it in the streams which flowed down from
the sides of the mountains.</p>

<p>These were watched by overseers, and the diamonds
were, when found, handed to superintendents.</p>

<p>The men worked in couples, and were allowed to
talk. They had three meals a day of coarse food,
and slept in wooden huts at night, laboring from
dawn to dusk.</p>

<p>Jack and Alfonso were supplied with a pickax, a
shovel and a basket.</p>

<p>They first picked down the earth or diamond-studded
dirt, then shoveled it into the basket, afterward
carrying it to the nearest shaft, where it was
taken in hand by others, and sent up to the surface.</p>

<p>"What are you in for?" asked Alfonso.</p>

<p>"They say I took a man's watch, and I got five
years," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," continued Alfonso; "I killed
my man, and I was sent 'down' for life."</p>

<p>Jack shuddered.</p>

<p>He was in the company of a murderer.</p>

<p>"Don't I wish I could get away!" continued the
ruffian.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Can you keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>"I tried to escape, but the soldiers, who are always
on guard, night and day, saw me and fired.
They brought me down. I've the bullet in my leg
now."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but they didn't get it," said Alfonso,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It? What do you mean by 'it'?"</p>

<p>"The diamond, my lad. I've got the biggest
beauty that ever came out of the mines."</p>

<p>"You have?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's worth a king's ransom. It ought
to be in the crown of a royal personage. It's fit for
an emperor."</p>

<p>"Is it so fine?"</p>

<p>"Magnificent. It's as big as the Koh-i-noor, which
is the largest in the world. I shall never get out,
though, so what use is it?"</p>

<p>He sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Why don't you give it to the authorities?" inquired
Jack.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me why I should?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do they treat us too well?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"Aren't we slaves and dogs, and lead a life of utter
and hopeless misery?"</p>

<p>"Very true."</p>

<p>"They shall never have it. No, my lad. It's
safe; but I've taken a fancy to you, and if anything
happens to me, I want you to know where it is."</p>

<p>Jack expressed his thankfulness for this proof of
the convict's good will.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" he asked, his curiosity being
aroused.</p>

<p>The convict bared his right leg and advanced to
the lamp which gave them the light by which they
were working.</p>

<p>"Any one around?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can't see any one," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"You never can tell when the overseers come
around. They're on the spy all the time."</p>

<p>"We are alone," Jack said.</p>

<p>"See here, then."</p>

<p>Alfonso took his hand and placed it on his flesh.
Jack felt a lump under the skin.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The diamond," replied Alfonso, under his breath.</p>

<p>"Impossible! how could it get there?" Jack
asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you they brought me down with a
bullet?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, they saw it had lodged just under the skin,
and the brutes didn't think it worth while to get the
doctor to cut it out. A day or two afterward I found
the diamond."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"So I takes a knife and cuts it out myself, and
seeing there was room for the bullet, I shoved the
diamond into the hole and let the skin grow over it
and there it is now."</p>

<p>"In your body?"</p>

<p>"In my living body," replied Alfonso, "and no
word of a lie about it."</p>

<p>"Didn't it hurt?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you it did. I suffered the tortures of the
damned for weeks, and it hurts now if I strain myself
or lie on that side."</p>

<p>Jack was overpowered with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You've got grit in you," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I killed my man? Any one
who's got pluck enough to slay his enemy and risk
the gallows can do anything," answered Alfonso.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"If I die, cut it out."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Hide it somewhere. I can't tell you where.
We must think."</p>

<p>Suddenly a mine-boss came along, with gentle,
cat-like footsteps.</p>

<p>"What are you two skulking for?" he asked, exhibiting
a rattan, his badge of office.</p>

<p>"Who's skulking?" asked Alfonso, savagely.</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>The murderer looked at him with a foreboding
gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>"Pedro," he said, "I warned you once before
not to interfere with me."</p>

<p>"It is my duty."</p>

<p>"Let me alone; I'm a desperate man, and I'd
just as soon be dead as working here. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand that you are threatening me," answered
Pedro, "and I shall report you."</p>

<p>This "report" meant fifty lashes on the bare
back of the prisoner, delivered publicly before retiring
to rest.</p>

<p>Alfonso gnashed his teeth savagely.</p>

<p>"Take care," he said.</p>

<p>"I shall report you twice if you do not instantly
go to work."</p>

<p>This was intended to convey the fact that the
punishment would be doubled, and the number of
lashes increased to one hundred.</p>

<p>Alfonso's eyes glared like those of a wild beast.</p>

<p>Jack shrank back, for he felt sure that some terrible
tragedy was about to take place.</p>

<p>In any case of disobedience reported by the overseers,
the convicts were unmercifully flogged with
a rawhide, and Alfonso had been treated to that
kind of discipline twice during his period of incarceration.</p>

<p>What wonder that a man condemned for life to
the most degrading drudgery, who had no hope of
a commutation of his sentence, and who could only
expect to die in his chains, should rebel when he
thought himself persecuted by those in authority
over him?</p>

<p>"I have warned you," said Alfonso, in a strangled
voice.</p>

<p>"And I have warned you," replied the keeper.</p>

<p>"Recollect that I have already killed one man."</p>

<p>"Bah!" replied Pedro, the keeper, drawing a pistol.
"If you were so much as to raise your little
finger toward me, I would stretch you a corpse on
this floor."</p>

<p>"What should I be doing to let you?" asked Pedro,
with a sneer which was peculiarly aggravating.</p>

<p>Alfonso breathed heavily.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to report me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do, and you know very well what
that means."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;do," answered the convict&mdash;speaking
with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>"No need of it; my back bears the record."</p>

<p>"For two days in succession, my friend," exclaimed
Pedro, who seemed to take a pleasure in
tormenting the convict, "you will be flogged in
the presence of your companions."</p>

<p>Alfonso's herculean frame trembled, and he shook
like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>"God!" he cried, uplifting his eyes to the dark
rock above him, "my time has come&mdash;and his."</p>

<p>With a wild gasp he sprang upon Pedro.</p>

<p>Harkaway would have interfered, but he saw
that it was useless to make any attempt to separate
them.</p>

<p>It was a duel to the death between these two
men.</p>

<p>He would only have endangered his own life and
have done no good.</p>

<p>Pedro discharged his pistol, as he had threatened
to do, but Alfonso received the bullet in his left
shoulder without flinching. With his right hand he
drove the sharp point of his pick into the skull of
the keeper.</p>

<p>Pedro fell with a groan.</p>

<p>Again and again the infuriated convict struck
him until, in his mad frenzy, he had smashed his
skull into a jelly.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Settled him, any way. There is one mine-boss
gone, and the world is rid of another petty tyrant,"
replied Alfonso.</p>

<p>"And what will become of you?"</p>

<p>"I shall solve the great problem, my friend,"
said the convict, now a double murderer.</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the pistol which Pedro
had allowed to drop from his hand.</p>

<p>"You do not mean that you will take your own
life?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I do mean."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Alfonso. "I take you to
be a sensible man, though young. What have I, a
slave, to live for? Is it any pleasure to me to exist,
as I have been existing for the last year, since I
have been in this infernal place?"</p>

<p>"No, I admit that; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"While there is life there is hope."</p>

<p>"Not for such as I. Have I not killed this man,
almost in self-defense, I may say?"</p>

<p>"I admit it."</p>

<p>"Well, if I live a few hours more they will seize
me, flog me till I am in a dying condition, and then
hang me. Why should I not die now?"</p>

<p>Harkaway could not see any valid reason why he
should prolong his miserable and forfeited existence.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said. "It is clear that suicide
in your case is an atonement, if not a virtue."</p>

<p>"Comrade," exclaimed Alfonso, "they say that
those who are about to die see future events
clearly."</p>

<p>"I have heard that," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"I can see you free and happy."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Jack. "When?"</p>

<p>"Before long. I congratulate you. Do not forget
what I told you about the diamond."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"Cut it out as soon as I am dead, and then give
the alarm at the mouth of the shaft."</p>

<p>"I will; but where shall I put it?"</p>

<p>Alfonso looked wildly around him.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I can't tell," he replied. "My
brain is in a whirl. I hear strange voices ringing in
my ears. Angels are talking to me. I am conversing
with the spirits of the mighty dead and they
bid me come to them."</p>

<p>Jack saw now that the man was crazed.</p>

<p>His troubles and his hard lot had weakened his
mind, and he was no longer responsible for his actions.</p>

<p>What ought he to do under the circumstances?</p>

<p>If he snatched the pistol from his hand, he would
run the risk of being shot, and it would be no charity
to the poor wretch to save his life in order that, after
cruelly torturing him, the authorities at the mines
might take it in a few hours.</p>

<p>Holding out his hand, he said:</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>The murderer grasped it warmly.</p>

<p>"You say good-by! Have you anything to add?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. God bless you and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack hesitated.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you, for His Son's sake."</p>

<p>"Good! <i>Adios</i>, signor."</p>

<p>These were the last words that Alfonso spoke, for
he placed the muzzle of the pistol against his right
temple and fired.</p>

<p>There was a loud report, which gave out cavernous
echoes, a thick smoke, which nearly obscured
the light of the lamp, and the murderer fell prostrate
over the corpse of the mine boss.</p>

<p>The bullet had done its work only too well.</p>

<p>He died without a word, a sigh, or a groan.</p>

<p class="center">MISS VANHOOSEN TRAVELS.</p>


<p>Lord Maltravers took care that the papers,
containing an account of Harkaway's adventure
in the private box at the California theatre
with Elise Holt should reach Miss Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>Lena read the account with surprise and indignation.</p>

<p>"He cannot love me," she said, "or he would not
intrigue with a married woman."</p>

<p>She tried to harden her heart against men in general,
and Jack in particular.</p>

<p>It was singular that she could not succeed, however,
for she had to confess to herself that she still
loved him.</p>

<p>A copy of the paper had also been sent to Mrs.
Vanhoosen, who gloried in it.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she exclaimed, "what did I always
tell you about that man?"</p>

<p>"I know you never liked him, mamma."</p>

<p>"Is not my judgment verified now?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Lena, "though one ought not
always to believe what one reads in the papers."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because they are untrustworthy nine times
out of ten," said Lena, who wished to defend her
absent lover, no matter how strong the proofs might
be against him.</p>

<p>"You should have married Maltravers."</p>

<p>"How could I, when he has a wife alive? What
nonsense you talk, mamma! He killed the poor
creature, and if he is ever caught he will be hanged."</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Mrs. Vanhoosen. "I have
had a letter from him, in which he says that he is
about to return to England. No one here cares to
prosecute him. Who will send after him? Is the district-attorney
going to the expense of extraditing
him?"</p>

<p>"Really, mamma, I do not know, and I don't care
to argue the point with you," said Lena, with a
weary air.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It fatigues me."</p>

<p>"You should marry Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"I shall never marry now," answered Lena. "I
intend to devote myself to a life of single blessedness."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused abruptly.</p>

<p>"I know what you would say," exclaimed Mrs.
Vanhoosen. "This man Harkaway, whom you
love, has proved himself unworthy of you, as I
always said he was, and therefore you close your
heart against every one."</p>

<p>"Have it your own way."</p>

<p>"Are you not foolish?"</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Lena, with sudden energy, "if
you taunt me any more I will go into a convent."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you will not. I insist upon you visiting
Europe with me again," replied Mrs. Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>"What if I refuse?"</p>

<p>"I will disown you; turn you into the street, and
you can shift for yourself, ungrateful girl," replied
her mother, passionately.</p>

<p>"You expect that I will meet Maltravers and
marry him, after all that has occurred?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then you are greatly mistaken," said Lena, obstinately.</p>

<p>"My dear child," continued her mother, "consider
all you are losing. If you meet Maltravers in
Paris, you can get married, for he has no wife
alive now, and go and live in Switzerland, or some
quiet place, till this affair has blown over."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>At this moment Alfred Vanhoosen, who had been
absent in Albany for some little time, entered the
room.</p>

<p>His presence was unexpected, but it was as welcome
as the flowers in May to Lena, who dearly
loved her brother.</p>

<p>She knew that he was at all times her friend and
her protector.</p>

<p>"Alfred!" she exclaimed, grasping his hand, "I
am so glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"And I to see you, sis. Mamma, how are you?"</p>

<p>"Ailing, my dear," replied Mrs. Vanhoosen.
"My head has troubled me very much since you
have been away."</p>

<p>"Sorry for that. What have you got in your
hand, sissy?"</p>

<p>"A California paper."</p>

<p>"I thought as much. What is it about?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"That affair of Mr. Harkaway's, in San Francisco,"
replied Lena.</p>

<p>"Oho! Is that all? You have not seen the
<i>Chronicle</i> of a later date?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He produced a paper, in which he pointed out to
her a certain paragraph.</p>

<p>"I presume," he exclaimed, "that Lord Maltravers
sends you papers for his own purposes."</p>

<p>"Possibly," she answered, beginning to read.</p>

<p>"Who sends papers to you?" asked Mrs. Vanhoosen,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Dick Harvey keeps me posted, and I know just
what is going on. This is a game of chess between
Harkaway and Maltravers, and I am sorry to say
that his lordship has won the first two moves in the
game."</p>

<p>"Glad of it!" replied Mrs. Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Alfred, "you are not glad in
your heart."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you are too much of a lady and a
Christian to wish to see a scoundrel triumph over
an honest man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanhoosen sat down on the lounge and
fanned herself in a vigorous manner.</p>

<p>She did not condescend to make any reply.</p>

<p>Lena read the paragraph which her brother had
pointed out to her, and learnt from it some startling
facts.</p>

<p>It stated that Harkaway and his friends had been
stopped on their way to the Geysers by Vasquez
the celebrated bandit, who had been the scourge of
California for so long a time.</p>

<p>Harvey had been dangerously wounded, and Jack
had been carried off, nobody knew where.</p>

<p>When she had fully mastered the contents of
this news item, Lena uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" she exclaimed, "what is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Jack has been captured by bandits," replied
Lena. "Oh! what shall I&mdash;what ought I to do?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you, sis?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanhoosen rose and extended her hand.</p>

<p>"Allow me an opportunity to speak, if you
please," she said.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Alfred; "you are our mother,
and we are bound to hear you, although I
must say that if I were in Lena's place I would go
after Jack."</p>

<p>"Insolent boy!"</p>

<p>"No, mother, I am not insolent; but the girl
loves the man, and what is the use of interfering
between them?"</p>

<p>"She shall not marry him!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be undutiful or go against the
fifth commandment, mother, which tells us, very
properly, to honor our father and mother; but,
really, you are wrong in this case."</p>

<p>"Why, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Harkaway is an honorable and elegant gentleman
in every sense of the word, and by no means
a pauper. He can support Lena just as well as you
have supported her, and there is no reason why he
should not marry her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanhoosen tried to speak, but her rising
temper rendered her speechless.</p>

<p>Lena began to cry, and put her handkerchief to
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she sobbed; "I shall never see him
again."</p>

<p>Alfred Vanhoosen patted her on the cheek with
brotherly affection.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will, sis," he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! never, never!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Jack is not a man very easy
to kill, and I don't think Maltravers will get away
with him so easily as he thinks."</p>

<p>"God grant it."</p>

<p>"At any rate," continued Alfred, "I will proceed
at once to San Francisco and search for him."</p>

<p>"You will?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Lena seized him by the hand and looked imploringly
in his face.</p>

<p>"Take me with you," she exclaimed. "I shall
die if I stay here. This life is intolerable to me."</p>

<p>Alfred looked at his mother, as if he expected
some reproach from that proud, ambitious woman.</p>

<p>She was not really bad-hearted, but she was like
so many other mothers in the United States who desire
their daughters to marry some man from Europe
with a title rather than have one of their own
race, or at least, one who has nothing but his face
and his character to recommend him.</p>

<p>"You are a thankless child, and your conduct is
sharper than a serpent's tooth," said Mrs. Vanhoosen.</p>

<p>Lena held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she exclaimed, "we must part."</p>

<p>"What! am I to be deserted by my children?"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes. We cannot live together. There is
no sympathy between us. My love calls me far
away."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanhoosen became very angry. Her face
flushed. She tried to speak, and failed.</p>

<p>Suddenly she uttered a cry. Something seemed
to burst in her throat. She fell to the ground heavily.</p>

<p>A stream of blood rushed from her mouth.</p>

<p>In her anger she had broken a blood-vessel, and
her life was in danger.</p>

<p>Lena, now greatly alarmed, knelt down and supported
her parent's head.</p>

<p>A doctor was sent for, and he did all he could for
the unhappy woman, but there was internal hemorrhage,
and after lingering for three days, she
died.</p>

<p>Tho brother and sister were deeply grieved at
their mother's death, but they could not blame
themselves for her untimely end.</p>

<p>By her will she had divided her fortune equally
between them.</p>

<p>After the funeral, which was largely attended by
their numerous friends in New York, they decided
to go to California and unravel the mystery which
to them attended the fate of Jack Harkaway.</p>

<p>The journey across the continent was delightful.</p>

<p>Everything was so new that they forgot their
grief and were happy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE ESCAPE FROM THE MINES.</p>


<p>Alfonso, the desperate murderer, had effectually
put an end to all his earthly sufferings.</p>

<p>Jack quickly recovered from the shock which his
death had given him.</p>

<p>Taking a knife with which he was accustomed to
eat his dinner, he searched for the spot in the man's
leg where he claimed to have hidden the diamond.</p>

<p>It was with very little hope of finding it that he
did so.</p>

<p>The whole story seemed like the delirious ravings
of a madman. Cutting away the skin, a hard substance
fell out, which Jack picked up.</p>

<p>He had been at work in the mines long enough to
know what a diamond was.</p>

<p>Holding it to the light, he uttered a cry of surprise,
for he saw that he was the possessor of a
jewel of the first water and of prodigious size.</p>

<p>Alfonso had not lied to him.</p>

<p>The story was not the invention of a maniac, but
a solemn fact.</p>

<p>What should he do with it?</p>

<p>This question could not be decided off-hand, so
he slipped it in his pocket, with the reflection that
he yet had half the day to think the matter out.</p>

<p>The convicts were only searched at night, before
retiring to their quarters.</p>

<p>He was running a great risk, and he knew it.</p>

<p>If a diamond was found upon the person of a convict
he was instantly shot.</p>

<p>Not even a drum-head court-martial was held
upon him.</p>

<p>A squad of soldiers was ordered up with loaded
rifles, and in less time than it takes to tell it the unlucky
finder of the stone was dead.</p>

<p>Making his way to the shaft, where he knew a
guard was always stationed, Jack went to make
his report.</p>

<p>"What do you want, my man?" asked the officer
of the guard.</p>

<p>"Come to report, sir," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I worked with convict No. 9, Alfonso by name.
Overseer Pedro accused him of shirking his work,
and an altercation ensued. Pedro threatened to report
him twice. Alfonso attacked him with his
pick. A shot was fired; but Pedro was killed."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the officer; "an overseer slain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain."</p>

<p>"What were you about, not to prevent it?"</p>

<p>"I was powerless to interfere."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The whole thing was so sudden, captain," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Where is the assassin?" inquired the officer.</p>

<p>"He is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead also?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He snatched up the pistol of Pedro and
shot himself dead."</p>

<p>The officer turned to his men.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," he said, "take a file of the guard.
Go into that working and verify the truth of this
man's statement."</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted.</p>

<p>"If there are any dead bodies, bring them to the
shaft," continued the officer.</p>

<p>He again bestowed his attention upon Harkaway.</p>

<p>"You will consider yourself under arrest," he
added.</p>

<p>Jack nodded, and sat down on the ground between
two soldiers.</p>

<p>He wondered what would happen next.</p>

<p>Men who live an uncertain life enjoy an excitement
similar to that experienced by gamblers.</p>

<p>Jack did not know whether he would live to see
the sun set, and yet he felt more inclined to whistle
than cry.</p>

<p>At length the dead bodies were brought out and
sent up to the surface in the cage.</p>

<p>The officer followed with Jack.</p>

<p>On being informed of the tragedy, the governor
of the mines held an examination.</p>

<p>Harkaway told his story with such a straightforward,
truthful air, that he was instantly believed.</p>

<p>No blame attached to him.</p>

<p>"It wasn't your quarrel, my good fellow," said
the governor, "and I do not see how you could have
interfered successfully. These affairs must occur
in such a population as ours. It was clearly Pedro's
own fault for not using his pistol with more celerity
and not taking a better aim. You are discharged."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Jack. "Might I ask
you one favor?"</p>

<p>"Name it."</p>

<p>"I should like to work in the open air."</p>

<p>"Would you? That is not extraordinary. Most
people would."</p>

<p>"Cannot I wash the dirt when it comes out of the
mines?"</p>

<p>"We have enough already."</p>

<p>"If I go below I shall see those two men quarreling.
It will be enough to drive me crazy, and if I
become insane, the State will lose a valuable servant."</p>

<p>The governor laughed.</p>

<p>"I should think you had been a lawyer," he observed.</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"You know how to plead your cause so well."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, as if reflecting.</p>

<p>"Your answer, excellency," exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"This man's prayer."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I had forgotten him. His request is
granted. I was thinking of something else. Send
up the band of the regiment to my house. I have
to entertain two strangers to-day. They come from
Rio with letters from the Emperor himself."</p>

<p>The governor went away, and Jack was at once
taken to a stream, where, standing up to his waist
in water, he washed the dirt in a sieve as it was
brought to him in a barrow, from the mouth of the
mine, by another convict.</p>

<p>The bank of the stream on one side was several
feet above the water.</p>

<p>Jack had not been at work long before he heard
voices.</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw the governor and two gentlemen.</p>

<p>What was his surprise to see his friends, Harvey
and Mr. Mole?</p>

<p>They had evidently lost no time in following him
to the Brazils.</p>

<p>He was about to make an exclamation, when Mr.
Mole's foot slipped and he fell into the water.</p>

<p>Splashing about like a huge fish, he seized Jack
and pulled him down.</p>

<p>They rolled over and over.</p>

<p>"Help! I'm drowning!" cried Mole. "Never
could swim a stroke in my life, you know. Help
me, you clumsy slave, or I'll have you whipped!"</p>

<p>"No, you won't, Mr. Mole," said Jack, helping
him up.</p>

<p>"Ha! you know my name?"</p>

<p>"Yes; look at me."</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>The professor delightedly threw his arms round
Jack's neck, and hugged and kissed him with every
demonstration of unbounded affection.</p>

<p>The governor was astonished.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your friend?" he asked.
"Is he crazy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>The professor waved his hand.</p>

<p>"I've found him," he exclaimed. "It's Jack!"</p>

<p>They speedily made their way to the bank, and
Harvey was as much pleased as Mr. Mole had
been.</p>

<p>"Jack, my dear old fellow," he said; "thank
God you are alive and well."</p>

<p>Turning to the governor, he added:</p>

<p>"This, sir, is the gentleman whose pardon I have
brought you from the Emperor."</p>

<p>The governor bowed.</p>

<p>"One of our best prisoners," he replied. "I am
sorry to lose him; but, of course, he is free."</p>

<p>Jack was profoundly affected.</p>

<p>"We lost no time in following you," said Harvey.
"My wound was not a dangerous one, and as soon
as I got well enough to travel, we were off."</p>

<p>That day Jack, in a new suit of clothes, dined
with the governor and his friends.</p>

<p>He kept the diamond, which he had cut in San
Francisco afterward, and handsomely set.</p>

<p>"For Lena," he said.</p>

<p>They made their way to the city of Rio and took
the first steamer for Aspinwall, where they crossed
the Isthmus to Panama, and took ship again for
'Frisco.</p>

<p>On their arrival they bought the <i>Chronicle</i>, and
Jack read a paragraph in the fashionable intelligence:</p>

<p>"Miss Lena Vanhoosen and Mr. Alfred Vanhoosen
are staying at Black's Hotel, in the Yosemite Valley."</p>

<p>"Dick," he exclaimed, "we must travel again."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Lena is in California."</p>

<p>That evening they were traveling toward Merced,
and the next day they took the stage for the far-famed
valley, where they hoped to meet the Vanhoosens.</p>

<p>Of Lord Maltravers they heard absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>He seemed to have disappeared from the scene.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE ATTACK ON THE STAGE.</p>


<p>The journey by stage to that wonderful valley
which the Indians named the Yosemite has
been so often described that we will not take up
the time of our readers by dwelling on the marvelous
scenery of the Sierras.</p>

<p>Stopping for dinner at Mariposa, which is the first
resting-place after leaving Merced, where the railway
ends, the stage went on to Clark's Station.</p>

<p>About ten miles from the hotel there is the wonderful
grove of big trees, to see which is alone worth
a journey of three thousand miles.</p>

<p>When they were nearing the hotel they encountered
two shepherds, who were walking in great
haste.</p>

<p>"Take care," said one.</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked the driver, pulling up.</p>

<p>"Vasquez is on the road."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"He has just attacked the stage coming from
Clark's Station. We heard the shots as we were
tending our sheep hard by."</p>

<p>"Any one hurt?"</p>

<p>"The driver's killed. There were a lady and a
gentleman in the stage. They were carried off."</p>

<p>"Which way did the robbers go?"</p>

<p>"Toward the big trees. It is there Vasquez has
his camp."</p>

<p>"And where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To tell the sheriff of Mariposa."</p>

<p>Jack looked at Harvey.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we ought to go after these
robbers," said he.</p>

<p>"I'm willing," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>"My lads," said Jack to the shepherds, "do you
know the country about here?"</p>

<p>"Ed does," replied one, indicating his companion.</p>

<p>"All right; you go and mind your sheep. The
driver of the stage shall turn round and summon
the sheriff of Mariposa, while Ed shall guide my
friend and myself to the camp of the robbers."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do?" asked Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"You, sir, can walk to the hotel and wait for
us."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," replied Mole; "for I don't think my
poor old legs are strong enough to carry me over
hills and over mountains."</p>

<p>Everything was arranged in five minutes.</p>

<p>Jack had a way of organizing which would have
done credit to a veteran general.</p>

<p>Ed, the shepherd, was armed with a pistol, and
Jack and Harvey were similarly supplied.</p>

<p>"I've got some cooked mutton and some bread
close here," said Ed; "and I guess we ought to
take it with us, as we shall be hungry before morning."</p>

<p>Jack made no objection, and having put the provisions
in a bag, he slung it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The stage was in the middle of the narrow roadway
and the horses were cropping the rich grass
which grew by the side.</p>

<p>Lying on the road was the body of the dead
stage-driver, who had been shot through the
heart.</p>

<p>Jack saw something white on a seat of the stage,
and springing up on the wheel, seized it.</p>

<p>It was a handkerchief, and embroidered in one
corner was the name, "Lena V."</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried Jack.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"My dear Dick," replied Jack, "there is somebody
besides Vasquez in this outrage."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Here is Lena Vanhoosen's handkerchief, or I am
very much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and Vasquez would not want to carry
her off unless Lord Maltravers was with him."</p>

<p>"True enough," said Harvey.</p>

<p>Jack laughed in a quiet, satisfied manner.</p>

<p>"They reckoned without one thing," he exclaimed.
"They thought I was still working in the
mines of Brazil, and little imagined that Jack Harkaway
was on their track."</p>

<p>"They'll find it out, though, before long," said
Harvey, with a grin.</p>

<p>"You bet."</p>

<p>"Now, let us go ahead. They haven't much the
start of us."</p>

<p>"I'm ready."</p>

<p>Jack turned to the shepherd.</p>

<p>"Can you follow a trail?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I guess so, boss," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to 'guess.' Say whether you
can or not."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can."</p>

<p>"Good enough!"</p>

<p>"There isn't an Indian that can beat me at tracking
anything, whether it is man or beast."</p>

<p>"Start right away," said Jack, "and you shall
have a hundred dollars if we come up with Vasquez
before nightfall."</p>

<p>The shepherd looked carefully around, and soon
found the trail, heading off like a bloodhound who
had got the scent.</p>

<p>For six miles they toiled up-hill all the way until
they reached the vicinity of the big trees.</p>

<p>The gigantic monarchs of the forest struck them
with awe.</p>

<p>"Look at this wilderness," said Jack. "Do not
these solitary trees give you an idea of grandeur
that you never had before?"</p>

<p>"They do, indeed," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>The shepherd held up his hand warningly.</p>

<p>"Danger," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Right here. Look!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the left, and Jack saw a group
which riveted his attention.</p>

<p>A little way off was Vasquez. Near him were
Lord Maltravers, Lena, and Alfred Vanhoosen, the
two latter with their arms bound behind their backs.</p>

<p>Two men, attendants of Vasquez, guarded the
prisoners, who leant disconsolately against the huge
trunk of one of the trees.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you!" exclaimed Vasquez.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Maltravers.</p>

<p>"Shoot the brother."</p>

<p>"But the girl will never forgive me."</p>

<p>"Ah, pshaw! I'll do it for you," said the robber.</p>

<p>Maltravers endeavored to restrain him, but he
broke from him, and, presenting a pistol at Alfred
Vanhoosen, fired.</p>

<p>Alfred fell bleeding at his sister's feet.</p>

<p>But retribution, swift and sure, was at hand.</p>

<p>Jack aimed at him, and brought him down with a
well-directed bullet.</p>

<p>"Fire, Dick, fire!" he cried. "Shoot every
mother's son of them!"</p>

<p>Ed, the shepherd, and Harvey were not slow to
obey this injunction.</p>

<p>The two attendant robbers were hit before they
could realize that they were in the presence of enemies.</p>

<p>In fact, the surprise was complete.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>"Harkaway!" he exclaimed, while his knees
trembled under him.</p>

<p>"I am here," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Is it you, or your ghost?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not much ghost about me."</p>

<p>Maltravers saw that resistance was useless, and
at the same time he recognized the unpleasant fact
that any attempt at escape would be futile.</p>

<p>He was a doomed man.</p>

<p>Yet he made one effort to save himself.</p>

<p>"Will you let me go if I surrender?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>Lena Vanhoosen held out her hands, which she
had separated from the bonds that bound her.</p>

<p>"Save me! oh, save me!" she cried.</p>

<p>Maltravers hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>Then he leveled his pistol at Lena, as if his mind
was fully made up.</p>

<p>"If I cannot have her, you shall never possess
her!" he cried, savagely.</p>

<p>The next moment his pistol exploded, and Lena,
the blood flowing from a wound in her breast, fell
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Villain and coward!" exclaimed Jack, as he
emptied his revolver in the wretch's body.</p>

<p>Maltravers staggered and sank on his knees.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he said, as he feebly discharged
his pistol at Jack.</p>

<p>The shot went wide of the mark, but it struck the
shepherd, who was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>It was a scene of carnage.</p>

<p>Alfred Vanhoosen was dead, so was Vasquez and
his two followers, Maltravers was dying, and Lena
was in a like condition, while the shepherd would
never speak again.</p>

<p>Frantic with grief, Jack threw himself on the
body of his beloved.</p>

<p>"My darling, my baby!" he exclaimed; "speak
to me."</p>

<p>Lena raised her fast glazing eyes to him, but she
could not utter a word.</p>

<p>With bitter, scalding tears, Jack watched her die.</p>

<p>Let us draw a vail over this affecting scene.</p>

<p>Jack and Harvey went back to the hotel at
Clark's Station and sent men for the bodies.</p>

<p>The funeral of the slain took place at Mariposa.</p>

<p>Then Harkaway, Mr. Mole and Harvey returned
to England by way of New York.</p>

<p>It was long before he forgot his lost love, and for
years the name of Lena Vanhoosen was as dear to
him as that of Lord Maltravers was hateful.</p>


<p class="p2 center">THE END.</p>
